The Effect of Compost augmented with Streptomyces spp on Maize 
(Zea mays L.) rhizosphere microbial dynamics and plant development

Description
The research data refers to the green farming practice with the 
application of compost augmented with selected strains of 
Streptomyces spp which has critical importance for sustainable 
development in agriculture. Compositing of organic matter lies 
with the active microorganisms which decompose it in essential 
steps to release the bound nutrients in nutrient residues into 
available and soluble forms (Pathma and Sakthivel, 2012). The data 
presented in this article include the effect of different strains 
of Streptomyces spp in single and combined treatment applications 
for germination and growth of maize shoot and root. These data may 
help in further evaluation of the use of filamentous bacteria of 
the genera Streptomyces for composting of cattle manure to enhance 
soil fertility for plant growth and control of plant diseases. 
Key words:  compost; chicken manure; cow manure; Streptomyces; 
plant growth promoting rhizobacteria; phytohormones
