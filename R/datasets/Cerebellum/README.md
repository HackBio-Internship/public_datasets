# Cerebellum
There are 4 datasets here showing the reponse (gene expression) of the 500 genes in the cerebellum to 4 different drugs; PFA-R1, PFA-R2, PRA-R3 and PFA-R4.

Your task, create a shiny app that:
1. Displays a volcano plot for a dataset when you select it. ( volcano plot is a scatter plot of log2FC on the x-axis and -1*log(qvalue) on y-axis) when you 
2. Displys the log2FC of each gene across all 4 datasets when selected. 

See sample below in the image below.
