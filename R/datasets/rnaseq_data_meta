To generate a volcano plot of RNA-seq results, we need a file of differentially expressed results which is provided for you here. To generate this file yourself, see the RNA-seq counts to genes tutorial. The file used here was generated from limma-voom but you could use a file from any RNA-seq differential expression tool, such as edgeR or DESeq2, as long as it has the required columns (see below).

The data for this tutorial comes from Fu et al. 2015. This study examined the expression profiles of basal and luminal cells in the mammary gland of virgin, pregnant and lactating mice. Here we will visualize the results of the luminal pregnant vs lactating comparison
