Growth and Toxigenicity of A. flavus on Resistant and Susceptible Peanut Genotypes

Description
This study seeks to determine the reaction of peanut genotypes to  Aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus inoculation and also determine the mechanisms of their resistance. It was established that non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus grows faster than aflatoxigenic A. flavus. There was no significant difference in the incidence and severity of the A. flavus resistant genotypes (L027B and ICGV-03401) however, there were significant differences between resistant genotypes and the susceptible check Manipinta.  This study also confirmed that non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus inoculation did not lead to aflatoxin production. Non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus identified could serve as  a good biocontrol against aflatoxin contamination under field conditions. Additionally, peanut genotypes with resistance to post-harvest aflatoxin accumulation will resist the growth of A. flavus and subsequent aflatoxin accumulation.
